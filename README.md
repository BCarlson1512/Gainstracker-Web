## Roadmap (AKA: A long todo list)

## The Why

## The Stack

- The primary stack chosen for this project mirrors the T3 stack, created by Theo Browne. (https://create.t3.gg/)
- T3 Leverages the following technologies/languages

### Typescript

- It's 2023... not to bash the javascript devs, but if you haven't switched to ts it's time
- This is the primary lang used within this project

### TailwindCSS

- TLDR: Ease of use like a component library, styling freedom of CSS. This library aggregates css properties into groups which are processed using className

### NextJS

- A server-side framework for React.js, primarily used for the flexibility to use SSR and ability to build an API into our web application

### TRPC

- A middleware used primarily to ensure typesafe interactions from both the client and server side

### Prisma

- Similar to an ORM. When used with TRPC, ensures full type safety from the API to database
